                    <h5>Life's better when you rent room</h5>
                    <p>Renting a room beats living on hostel or your parent's house. When you rent a room, you don't just share your house - you share your life.</p>
                    <p>They become more than your flatmates, more than the people ahead of you in the queue for the bathroom. They're your friends.</p>
                    <P>RentMyRoom is all about helping you find those people. The people who make renting room amazing.</P>
